# Getting Started

As per the instructions, I used a static map with the specified values. Ideally I would have used a database.
I made the map public so that it can be called for reading. This should not have happened in a real-world environment, but rather offer methods for getting the inventory.
I saw the API was down for a while, so I didn't interact with it. I can use circuit-breaker to treat the unavailability.
